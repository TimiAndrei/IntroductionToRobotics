This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers. We will use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. Specifically, we will read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.
